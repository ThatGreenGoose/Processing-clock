# Processing-clock
a simple time date and weather clock i built in processing. crude but effective

this is the first attempt at building a clock that tell the time, date, weather and temperture.

It uses openweathermaps so a free api key is nessessary to get the weather to work

Currently it has no mechinisim to cancel out screen timeout but that can be disabled seperatly.
